Table S4 – Correlation between principal components (PCs) and the 19 WorldClim bioclimatic variables. Bioclimatic variables were passively projected onto the PC space using the envfit function from the R package Vegan. To account for data nestedness (plots in sites), the permutation was constrained using forest sites as strata.

Figure S20 – Diving board plot of species-specific change-points for pure and reliable indicator species in oak-dominated forests. For win-win species, the horizontal lines extend from the highest observed above-ground live carbon value to the 5th percentile of the permuted distribution of change-points. For trade-off species the horizontal lines extend from the lowest observed above-ground live carbon value to the 95th percentile. The size of the symbols is proportional to species’ indicator value (z-scores). Only species having a level of purity and reliability higher than 0.95 were reported. We reported the limits of the confidence interval, as these conservatively indicate the point along the above-ground live carbon gradient above (below) which the trade-off (win-win) species potentially decline (increase).
